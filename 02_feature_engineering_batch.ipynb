    "\n",
    "[Fraudfinder](https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/fraudfinder) is a series of labs on how to build a real-time fraud detection system on Google Cloud. Throughout the Fraudfinder labs, you will learn how to read historical bank transaction data stored in data warehouse, read from a live stream of new transactions, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), do feature engineering, ingest features into a feature store, train a model using feature store, register your model in a model registry, evaluate your model, deploy your model to an endpoint, do real-time inference on your model with feature store, and monitor your model."

    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "As you engineer features for model training, it's important to consider how the features are computed when making predictions with new data. For online predictions, you may have features that can be pre-computed via _batch feature engineering_. You may also features that need to be computed on-the-fly via _streaming-based feature engineering_. For these Fraudfinder labs, for computing features based on the last n _days_, you will use _batch_ feature engineering in BigQuery; for computing features based on the last n _minutes_, you will use _streaming-based_ feature engineering using Dataflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to generate new features on bank transactions by customer and terminal over the last n days, by doing batch feature engineering in SQL with BigQuery. Then, you will create a feature store using Vertex AI Feature Store, and ingest your newly-created features from BigQuery into Vertex AI Feature Store, so that a feature store can become the single source of data for both training and model inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also create some placeholder values for streaming-based feature engineering, which is covered in the next notebook, `03_feature_engineering_streaming.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab uses the following Google Cloud services and resources:\n",

    "### What is a feature store?\n",
    "\n",
    "The features generated are great examples of features that we can store the [Vertex AI Feature Store](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore). This is because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The features are needed for real-time prediction\n",
    "- feature values in a feature store can be used for both training and serving\n",
    "- if needed, features can be shared with other use cases beyond fraud detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Vertex AI Feature Store provides a centralized repository for organizing, storing, and serving ML features. Using a central featurestore enables an organization to efficiently share, discover, and re-use ML features at scale, which can increase the velocity of developing and deploying new ML applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why would you like to set up it?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far you've built and stored features in BigQuery. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in order to predict fraud, you want to serve those features in real-time with millisecond scale latency. In particular, when the ML gateway receives a prediction request for a specific transaction (including customer, terminal, and transaction ids), the system needs to fetch the features related to that transaction and pass them as inputs to the model for online prediction. As you can imagine, an analytical data warehouse such as BigQuery is not able to provide low-latency near real-time read operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Vertex AI Feature Store provides a managed service for low latency scalable feature serving. It also provides a centralized feature repository with easy APIs to search and discover features, as well as feature monitoring capabilities to track drift and other quality issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "Vertex AI Feature Store uses a time series data model to store a series of values for features, which enables Vertex AI Feature Store to maintain feature values as they change over time and to support point-in-time queries of feature values. Feature Store organizes resources hierarchically (`Featurestore -> EntityType -> Feature`) in the following order: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Featurestore**: the resource to contains entities and features.\n",
    "    - **EntityType**: under a Featurestore, an EntityType describes an minimal data entry.\n",
    "        - **Feature**: under an EntityType, a feature is an attribute of the EntityType. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You must create these resources before you can ingest data into a Feature Store. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the follow section, you will use create a feature store using Vertex AI Feature Store, and ingest data into it to be used later for training and model inference."
