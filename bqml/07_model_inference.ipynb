    "[FraudFinder](https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/fraudfinder) is a series of labs on how to build a real-time fraud detection system on Google Cloud. Throughout the FraudFinder labs, you will learn how to read historical bank transaction data stored in data warehouse, read from a live stream of new transactions, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), do feature engineering, ingest features into a feature store, train a model using feature store, register your model in a model registry, evaluate your model, deploy your model to an endpoint, do real-time inference on your model with feature store, and monitor your model."

    "In this notebook, you will create a Cloud Run app to perform model inference on the endpoint deployed in the previous notebooks. This Cloud Run app will be triggered by the Pub/Sub subscriber for live transactions, perform a look-up on feature values from the feature store you created in earlier notebooks, and send the prediction request to the Vertex AI endpoint. You can then view the resulting prediction-response logs in BigQuery.\n",
